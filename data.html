<p>The annotations for the task will be released on the <a href="https://github.com/ncg-task" target="_blank">NLPContributionTask Github account</a>. The following releases are currently available:</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Corpus Annotation</h3>
<p>The NLPContributionTask comprises a corpus of scholarly articles in Natural Language Processing research focused on Machine Learning applications and was annotated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The annotator identified contribution-related sentences, entities, and their triples</li>
<li>In an adjudication phase, the annotations were revised as seen necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>The annotation methodology can be found described in the arxiv article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12870" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Data Format</h3>
<p>The NLPContribution data is in the following format. For the training and dev sets, for each annotated scholarly article in the corpus, there will be a directory. That directory will contain a plain text file which is the article's full text, preprocessed for tokenization and sentence splitting; and there will be three text files: <strong>Sentences.txt</strong> will contain the annotated contribution sentence numbers from the full-text file; <strong>Entity.txt</strong> will contain the sentence number, tab-separated from the start and end token numbers of the annotated entity in the sentence; and <strong>Triples.txt</strong> will contain the triples of the entity annotations, unless the predicates are inferred additionally, in which case they will be shown as strings. Samples of the annotations are released as <a href="https://github.com/ncg-task/NLPContributions" target="_blank">trial data</a>.</p>
